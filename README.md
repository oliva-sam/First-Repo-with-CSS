# FirstRepo-with-CSS

This is very similar to [FirstRepo] (https://github.com/oliva-sam/FirstRepo) , however this repo has a CSS file added. 

I wanted to showcase my progress on github through different repos.

In doing a seperate repo, I'm also able to practice coding HTML, as well. :simple_smile:
